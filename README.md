### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eniola Ipoola, and I build scalable and testable Android applications. 
I have contributed to various Android products, from small to large complex applications. In the process, 
I have honed my ability to handle diverse challenges and resolve critical issues.

Also, I have deep expertise in Android frameworks and concepts. I build Android applications in Java and Kotlin, 
integrating unit tests and dependency injection.Â  I also define project architecture and write technical documentation. 
I am a good problem solver, I have a proven track record of developing successful Android products that exceed users' expectations.

Here is a link to projects I have developed/contributed to [Portfolio](https://eniolaipoola.notion.site/Taiwo-Eniola-Ipoola-a5d82399a25942dda78e00eca14868ec)
